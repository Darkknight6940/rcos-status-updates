## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week I sent a email to Prof. Turner to talk about applying the servers in RPI to support our web. 
He recommend that we should develop on a Docker instance. That way, once we have something working locally, RPI can easily migrate it to the web once you are ready for public testing. 
Here's the link of the example :https://github.com/rcos/docker-examples
So I kept learning PHP and how to develop a Docker instance
